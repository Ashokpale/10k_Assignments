        Ernesto "Che" Guevara (Spanish: [ˈtʃe ɣeˈβaɾa];[3] 14 June 1928[1] – 9 October 1967) was an Argentine <a

            revolutionary</a>, physician, author, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare "

    <p>As a young medical student, Guevara traveled throughout South America and was appalled by the poverty,
        hunger,
        and disease he witnessed.[5][6] His burgeoning desire to help overturn what he saw as the capitalist
        exploitation of Latin America by the United States prompted his involvement in Guatemala's social reforms
        under President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobo_%C3%81rbenz" target="_blank">Jacobo Árbenz</a>,
        whose eventual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company" target="_blank">United Fruit Company</a>

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C3%BAl_Castro" target="_blank">Raúl</a> and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro" target="_blank">Fidel Castro</a>, joined
        their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/26th_of_July_Movement" target="_blank">26th of July Movement</a>,
        and sailed to Cuba aboard the yacht Granma with the intention of overthrowing
        US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista.[7] Guevara soon rose to prominence among the insurgents, was promoted
        to
        second-in-command, and played a pivotal role in the two-year guerrilla campaign that deposed the Batista
        regime.

        After the Cuban Revolution, Guevara played key roles in the new government. These included reviewing the appeals
        and firing squads for those convicted as war criminals during <a

            target="_blank">agrarian land reform</a> as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_minister" target="_self">minister of industries</a>, helping spearhead a successful
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_literacy_campaign" target="_blank">nationwide literacy campaign</a>,
        serving as both president of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bank_of_Cuba" target="_self">National Bank</a> and instructional director for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba%27s_armed_forces" target="_blank">Cuba's armed forces</a>, and
        traversing the globe as a diplomat on behalf of Cuban socialism. Such positions also allowed him to play a
        central role in training the militia forces who repelled the Bay of Pigs Invasion,[10] and bringing Soviet
        nuclear-armed ballistic missiles to Cuba, which preceded the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.[11] Additionally,
        Guevara was a prolific writer and diarist, composing a seminal guerrilla warfare manual, along with a
        best-selling memoir about his youthful continental motorcycle journey. His experiences and studying of
        Marxism–Leninism led him to posit that the Third World's underdevelopment and dependence was an intrinsic result
        of imperialism, neocolonialism, and monopoly capitalism, with the only remedies being proletarian
        internationalism and world revolution.[12][13] Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to foment continental revolutions
        across both Africa and South America,[14] first unsuccessfully in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simba_rebellion" target="
        _blank">Congo-Kinshasa</a> and later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivian_Campaign" target="_self">in Bolivia</a>, where he
        was captured by CIA-assisted Bolivian forces and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summarily_executed" target="_blank">summarily executed</a>.[15]
